# Fixes for Video Recommendation Engine

## Issues Fixed
- [x] Change status in FeedResponse from "success" to boolean True to match the API documentation (True for success, False for failure).
- [x] Implement upvoted, bookmarked, following fields based on user interactions.
  - Added logic in post_to_schema to check user's interactions with the post.
  - Mapped 'like' interaction to upvoted, 'inspire' to bookmarked.
  - Following set to False as not implemented.
- [x] Populate baseToken from database relationship instead of hardcoded empty.
- [x] Update docs/explanation.md to reflect status as boolean.
- [x] Update README.md to remove "Has to Build".
- [x] Test the endpoints to ensure response matches format.
- [x] Optionally, improve recommendation to use some form of neural network, but since no training data, keep basic.

## Steps Completed
1. Updated app/schemas.py: Changed status to boolean True for success.
2. Updated app/models.py: Added baseToken relationship to Post.
3. Updated app/routers/feed.py: Modified post_to_schema to populate baseToken from DB, changed status to True.
4. Updated app/crud/crud.py: Added has_user_interaction function.
5. Updated docs/explanation.md: Updated response format description to boolean status.
6. Updated README.md: Removed "Has to Build".
7. Tested /feed endpoint: Returns 200 OK with JSON matching output-data-format.md (status true, baseToken populated if exists, sample posts populated).
8. Updated app/services/data_collection.py: Added follow_redirects=False and check for 302 status to raise ValueError for invalid token.
