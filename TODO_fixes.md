# Fixes for Video Recommendation Engine

## Issues Fixed
- [x] Change status in FeedResponse from "True" to "success" to match example JSON.
- [x] Implement upvoted, bookmarked, following fields based on user interactions.
  - Added logic in post_to_schema to check user's interactions with the post.
  - Mapped 'like' interaction to upvoted, 'inspire' to bookmarked.
  - Following set to False as not implemented.
- [x] Update docs/explanation.md to reflect changes.
- [x] Update README.md to remove "Has to Build".
- [ ] Test the endpoints to ensure response matches format.
- [ ] Optionally, improve recommendation to use some form of neural network, but since no training data, keep basic.

## Steps Completed
1. Updated app/schemas.py: Changed status default to "success".
2. Updated app/crud/crud.py: Added has_user_interaction function.
3. Updated app/routers/feed.py: Modified post_to_schema to take db and user_id, set interactions.
4. Updated docs/explanation.md: Updated response format description.
5. Updated README.md: Removed "Has to Build".
6. Next: Test by running the server and checking /feed endpoint.
